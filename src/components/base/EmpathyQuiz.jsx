                <strong>Quiz Introduction:</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Ever wonder how well you vibe with others' feelings?
                That&rsquo;s called empathy. Empathy is like feeling a friend's
                happiness or sadness in your own heart and being there for them.
                It's understanding how someone else feels, even if you're not in
                their shoes.
              </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>
                This fun quiz is kinda like finding out your snack spirit when
                it comes to empathy. Let's see what snack you turn out to be!

                <strong>Instructions:</strong>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Read each scenario-based question and the answer choices.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Pick the answer that sounds most like YOU.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Make sure you answer each question honestly, basing your
                    responses on your actual behavior and feelings, not how you
                    think you 'should' answer. There are no right or wrong
                    answers.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    At the end of the quiz, based on your responses, you'll be
                    presented with one of the three snack choices that reflect
                    and represent your current empathy level.

                            It's not that you don't care about others; maybe
                            you're just in a phase where you're figuring things
                            out for yourself.

                            kinda cool when you really get to know them better.
                            Little things, like asking about their day or
                            remembering their favorite drink, can make a big
                            difference.{" "}

                          Nice! You're like those cookies baked with care and
                          love. You often get how your friends feel and want to
                          help, just like making cookies for a friend who's
                          down. But sometimes, some tiny details might zip past
                          you.

                        <p>
                          <strong>Friendly Tip:</strong> Keep it up! Try joining
                          a group or club at school to practice listening and
                          understanding even better. Little things like helping
                          out or just chatting can help you connect even deeper
                          with others.

                          just do whatever takes the least effort to understand
                          and listen to how someone feels.

                Reflect on your result. Does your snack align with how you think
                of yourself? Are you surprised by your snack choice?
              </p>

              <p>
                If you didnâ€™t score as high as you hoped, no worries! Everyone
                has the power to grow their empathy. Try being more mindful of
                how well you listen to others, immerse yourself in books and
                movies to try to feel what the characters are feeling, or do
                something kind for someone without expecting anything back. If
                you scored high, give yourself a pat on the back. This shows you
                have a big heart and a remarkable ability to connect with and
                understand others.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>
                No matter what you score, the journey of empathy doesn't end
                here! Empathy is like a muscle - the more you use it, the
                stronger it becomes. It's important to keep challenging
                yourself, listen more deeply, and always seek to understand
                others better.{" "}
