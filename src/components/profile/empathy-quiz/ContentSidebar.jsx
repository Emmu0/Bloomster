            Reflect on your result. Does your snack align with how you think of
            yourself? Are you surprised by your snack choice?

            If you didnâ€™t score as high as you hoped, no worries! Everyone has
            the power to grow their empathy. Try being more mindful of how well
            you listen to others, immerse yourself in books and movies to try to
            feel what the characters are feeling, or do something kind for
            someone without expecting anything back. If you scored high, give
            yourself a pat on the back. This shows you have a big heart and a
            remarkable ability to connect with and understand others.{" "}

            No matter what you score, the journey of empathy doesn't end here!
            Empathy is like a muscle - the more you use it, the stronger it
            becomes. It's important to keep challenging yourself, listen more
            deeply, and always seek to understand others better.{" "}

            <strong>Quiz Introduction:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Ever wonder how well you vibe with others' feelings? That&rsquo;s
            called empathy. Empathy is like feeling a friend's happiness or
            sadness in your own heart and being there for them. It's
            understanding how someone else feels, even if you're not in their
            shoes.
